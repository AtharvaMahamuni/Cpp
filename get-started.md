So let's start with first question that, what is competitive programming and why it is important and how to start?
-> Go through this link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prepare-for-competitive-programming/
After reading this if you want big-picture about how to preapare for CP then go through this link this is the best answer on the internet(according to me)
about getting started with competetive programming https://www.hackerearth.com/getstarted-competitive-programming/
All things are well explained in this answer 

If your convinced with this answer then lets proceed to second question that is very common that why to choose c/c++ for CP?
-> For this I will recommend to go through this forum of codechef which will give you an idea that why programming community
prfer c++ over other languages. https://discuss.codechef.com/t/python-or-c/29694
If you want short answer then C++ is much faster than python and java and it contain STL template library which will help you to 
make it easy to code for competitive programming.
As a competitive programming is like a sports then you can't give excuses about language so it is better to do CP with C++.

That's all I hope you have convienced to do competitive programming so let's proceed from very basic.

Prerequisites to follow this guid is just you need to know some basic concepts in programmin and that's all you can follow along.
