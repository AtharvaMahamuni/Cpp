Write a C++ program to compute the real roots of the equation: ax2+bx+c=0.

The program will prompt the user to input the values of a, b, and c. It then computes the real roots of the equation based on the following rules:
-if a and b are zero=> no solution
-if a is zero=>one root (-c/b)
-if b2-4ac is negative=>no roots
-Otherwise=> two roots
The roots can be computed using the following formula:
x1=-b+(b2-4ac)1/2/2a
x=-b-(b2-4ac)1/2/2a
