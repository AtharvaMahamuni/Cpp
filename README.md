This is competitive programming guide from myself.
I am trying to become good at competetive programming and this is the guide which I am building throughout my journy.
I hope when you find this it is at the postion were you can learn from it. I am trying to add something new every single day.
I will try to give answer of everything such as why I choosed this language or why I am using this data structure or why I am trying 
this approach as per my knowledge and understanding.
I hope this guide will help you to get started with CP. I am linking all useful links, problems and there solutions as well.
May be this guide will take 1-2 years for completion but Goal is not to win something but it is to become a problem solver.

This guide will start with some important concepts from c++ to all over mastering data structures and algorithms.
