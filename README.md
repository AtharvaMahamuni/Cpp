This is competitive programming guide from myself.
I am trying to become good at competetive programming and this is the guide which I am building throughout my journy.
I hope when you find this it is at the postion were you can learn from it. I am trying to add something new every single day.

I hope this guide will help you to start with CP. I am linking all useful links and problems and there solutions here.
(Suggetions are always welcome email address: atharvamahamuni54@gmail.com

This guide will start with some important concepts from c++ to all over mastering data structures and algorithms.
I will try to give answer of everything that why I choosed this language or why I am using this data structure or why I am trying 
this approach as per my knowledge and understanding.

May be this guide will take 1-2 years for completion but Goal is not to win at something but it is to become a problem solver.

So let's start with first question that, what is competitive programming and why it is important and how to start?
Go through this link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-prepare-for-competitive-programming/
After reading this if you want big-picture about how to preapare for CP then go through this link this is the best answer on the internet(according to me)
about getting started with competetive programming https://www.hackerearth.com/getstarted-competitive-programming/
All things are well explained in this answer 

If your convinced with this answer then lets proceed to second qustion that is very common that why to choose c/c++ for CP?
