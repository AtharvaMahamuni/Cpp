//STL is divided into 4 components
//1. Iterators - Loop them like vectors.
//2. Functors - manage state, parameterized
//3. Algorithms - Search, sort
//4. Containers - Implementaion of well defined data structures.

//*** Containers:
//Sequence Types - Vectors, list, deques, stacks, queues
//Associative Types(used with binary trees) - Set, multisets, maps, multimaps(binary trees)
//Unordered Associative Types(used with hash map) - Set, multisets, maps, multimaps(binary trees)
