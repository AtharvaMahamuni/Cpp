Searching algorithms are basically used for searching an key element from given set of numbers.
For Input we are given with some set of numbers and key value.
In output we have to state that whether the key element is present or not.

There are 3 types of Searching Algorithms 
1. Linear Searching
2. Binary Searching 
3. Hashing


Linear Searching:
=================
In linear search we start to search the elemnt from first postition of an array till the last position.
when we get an eliment in array we set the flag to 1 and break the loop. If element is not found we keep 
flag as 0. Then we check the condition if flag is found as 1 then we say the element is present otherwise 
we say element is not present.
The best case for Linear Search is when the element is present at first postion,
and the worst case is when element is present at last position.
The timecomplexity of Linear search is O(n).



Binary Search:
==============
In binary search set of elements is sorted and we start to search from middle of an array.
If the element is present at the middle then it is the best case, otherwise we check whether the 
key element is smaller than or grater than the given element, if element is small we check at the right
half and if the element is grater we check at the right half. We keep searching for element until we can't 
break array further or until high can't become less than low. If element is found we make flag 1 otherwise it remain 0. 
This algorithm is also known as divide and conqure algorithm. 
The best case for this algorithm when the element is present at middle of an array,
and the worst case when the element is present at the start or end of an array.
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(logn).
