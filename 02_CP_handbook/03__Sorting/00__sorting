Sorting is a fundamental algorithm design problem.


There are many algorithms for sorting, and they are also good examples of
how to apply different algorithm design techniques. The efficient general sorting
algorithms work in O(nlogn) time, and many algorithms that use sorting as a
subroutine also have this time complexity.


**Sorting Theory:
=================
Given an array that contains n elements, your task is to sort the elements in
increasing order.

For example, the array
1 3 8 2 9 2 5 6

will be as follows after sorting:
1 2 2 3 5 6 8 9


Simple algorithms for sorting an array work in O(n2) time. Such algorithms
are short and usually consist of two nested loops. A famous O(n2) time sorting
algorith is bubble sort.
